Introduction
============

`SPADES` is an open-source solver for Parallel Discrete Events (PDES). It is a high-performance and performance-portable C++ solver that leverages the AMReX library. It can run on GPUs for acceleration and is compatible with GPUs from major manufacturers, such as AMD, NVIDIA, and Intel.

A variety of examples are included to provide a model setup for the various options. These are discussed further in the :ref:`Getting Started<GettingStarted>` section.


Dependencies
------------

`SPADES` is built on AMReX (available at `https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex <https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex>`_), a software framework which provides the underlying infrastructure for performance portability. The full AMReX documentation can be found `here <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex>`_.
